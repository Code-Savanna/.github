## 1. Code Style and Standards

### 1.1 General Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in coding styles and conventions throughout the project.
- **Readability**: Prioritize code readability. Write code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **Simplicity**: Keep functions and methods focused and concise. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself. Reuse code whenever possible to reduce redundancy.
- **Modularity**: Break down code into reusable modules or components.
- **Comments**: Use comments judiciously to explain complex logic or decisions.

### 1.2 Language-Specific Guidelines

#### Python

- Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Document functions and classes with docstrings using the [Google Python Style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md).
- Utilize type hints where appropriate.

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Adhere to the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.
- Use arrow functions for anonymous functions.
- Implement [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code linting and formatting.

#### Java

- Follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
- Use Javadoc comments for classes, methods, and significant variables.
- Utilize meaningful package names and adhere to standard naming conventions.

#### Other Languages

- Refer to the community-accepted style guide for the language in use.
- Ensure consistent formatting and conventions throughout the codebase.

## 2. Version Control Practices

We use Git for version control, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Code-Savanna).

### 2.1 Commits

- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages following the Conventional Commits format.
- **Commit Message Structure**:

  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <subject>
  
  <body>
  
  <footer>
  ```

  - **Type**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
  - **Scope**: The section of the codebase the commit affects.
  - **Subject**: Brief description of the change (use the imperative mood).
  - **Body**: Detailed explanation of the change (optional).
  - **Footer**: References to issues or breaking changes (optional).

- **Examples**:

  ```
  feat(auth): add JWT authentication support
  
  Implemented JWT authentication to enhance security. Users can now authenticate via tokens.
  
  Closes #123
  ```

  ```
  fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue on mobile
  
  Adjusted CSS flex properties to ensure buttons are properly aligned on smaller screens.
  ```

### 2.2 Branching Strategy

We follow the [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model.

- **Main Branches**:
  - `main`: Reflects the production-ready state.
  - `develop`: Contains the latest development changes for the next release.

- **Supporting Branches**:
  - **Feature Branches**: For developing new features (`feature/<feature-name>`).
  - **Bugfix Branches**: For fixing bugs (`bugfix/<bug-name>`).
  - **Release Branches**: For preparing a new production release (`release/<version-number>`).
  - **Hotfix Branches**: For critical fixes in production (`hotfix/<issue-number>`).

- **Branch Naming Conventions**:

  ```
  feature/<short-description>
  bugfix/<short-description>
  release/<version-number>
  hotfix/<issue-number>
  ```

- **Examples**:

  - `feature/add-user-profile`
  - `bugfix/fix-auth-token-expiry`
  - `release/2.0.0`
  - `hotfix/456`

## 3. Pull Requests

### 3.1 Creating a Pull Request

- **Title**: Use a clear and concise title summarizing the changes.
- **Description**:
  - Provide a detailed description of the changes.
  - Explain the purpose and context.
  - Include any relevant screenshots or logs.
- **Linked Issues**: Reference related issues using keywords like `Closes #issue-number`.
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Code compiles without errors.
  - [ ] All tests pass.
  - [ ] New features have appropriate tests.
  - [ ] Documentation is updated if necessary.
  - [ ] Code adheres to style guidelines.

### 3.2 Pull Request Reviews

- **Review Process**:
  - At least one team member must review and approve the PR before merging.
  - Automated checks (CI/CD pipelines) must pass.
- **Feedback**:
  - Provide constructive and actionable feedback.
  - Use inline comments for specific code snippets.
- **Response**:
  - Address feedback promptly.
  - Engage in respectful discussions if clarifications are needed.
- **Merging**:
  - Use "Squash and Merge" to maintain a clean history.
  - Ensure the commit message is clear and follows conventions.

---

## 4. Testing

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Write unit tests for all new code.
  - Aim for high code coverage (minimum 80%).
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test interactions between different components or systems.
- **End-to-End Tests**:
  - Simulate real user scenarios to validate the entire application flow.
- **Testing Tools**:
  - Use language-specific testing frameworks (e.g., `pytest`, `Jest`, `JUnit`).
- **Continuous Testing**:
  - Integrate tests into the CI pipeline to run on every commit.

---

## 5. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **CI Tools**:
  - Utilize [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for automated builds and tests.
- **Build Automation**:
  - Automate builds to ensure consistency across environments.
- **Deployment**:
  - Follow the standardized deployment process.
  - Use staging environments for testing before production releases.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Store sensitive data like API keys in environment variables.
  - Do not commit sensitive information to the repository.
- **Notifications**:
  - Configure alerts for build failures or deployment issues.

---

## 6. Code Reviews

- **Responsibilities of Reviewers**:
  - Verify code correctness and compliance with standards.
  - Check for potential bugs or security vulnerabilities.
  - Ensure code is well-documented and maintainable.
- **Etiquette**:
  - Be respectful and professional.
  - Focus on the code, not the individual.
  - Provide constructive criticism with suggestions for improvement.
- **Timeliness**:
  - Aim to review pull requests within 24 hours.

  - Never commit passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information.
  - Use tools like [Git Secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) to prevent accidental commits.
- **Dependency Management**:
  - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
  - Use tools like [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) for automated dependency updates.
- **Input Validation**:
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
  - Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage.

## 9. Performance Optimization

- **Efficiency**:
  - Write efficient algorithms and data structures.
  - Avoid unnecessary computations and memory usage.
- **Profiling**:
  - Use profiling tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
- **Scalability**:
  - Design systems that can scale horizontally and vertically.
  - Consider load balancing and distributed architectures where necessary.
- **Caching**:
