## Before Submitting an Issue

1. **Search Existing Issues**:  
   Please **search the [existing issues](https://github.com/CodeSavanna/repo/issues)** to see if your problem or feature request has already been reported. This prevents duplicate issues and consolidates conversations.

2. **Check Documentation**:  
   Ensure you've read through the [project documentation](https://github.com/CodeSavanna/repo/wiki) and FAQs. Many common questions may already be answered there.

## How to Submit an Issue

### Step 1: Select the Correct Issue Template

- Go to the **Issues** tab in the repository.
- Click on **New Issue** and select the appropriate issue template (Bug, Feature Request, Documentation, etc.).

### Step 2: Provide a Descriptive Title

Use a short, clear title that describes your issue, such as:
- **"Bug: API returns 500 error when querying for data"**
- **"Feature Request: Add dark mode support to the dashboard"**

### Step 3: Fill Out the Issue Template

Follow the instructions in the issue template, providing as much detail as possible:
- **For bugs**: Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, screenshots, and environment details (OS, browser, versions, etc.).
- **For features**: Describe your idea, how it could benefit the project, and potential implementation suggestions.
- **For documentation**: Specify which part of the documentation needs improvement and what changes you would like to see.

### Step 4: Add Relevant Labels

## Issue Triage Process

Once you submit an issue:
1. **Review**: A project maintainer or contributor will review your issue within 48 hours (or sooner).
2. **Discussion**: If needed, we'll ask clarifying questions or request more information.
3. **Labeling**: The issue will be labeled based on its type (`bug`, `feature`, etc.) and priority.
4. **Resolution**: The issue will either be:
   - **Accepted** and assigned for further action.
   - **Closed** if it's a duplicate, invalid, or cannot be reproduced.
   - **Transferred** to a discussion thread if it’s better suited for general input or brainstorming.

## Following Up on Your Issue

- You can track the status of your issue under the **Issues** tab.
- You’ll receive notifications when updates are made to your issue.
- If your issue is resolved in a pull request (PR), the issue will be automatically closed when the PR is merged.
